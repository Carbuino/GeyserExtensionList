# GeyserExtensionList
A list of known Extensions &amp; how to get them.

## I am not the creator of these extensions. If you want your extension do be on this list, create a pull request. 

will update to some proper solution in the future, similar to https://github.com/comp500/quilt-serverside-mods if there are enough extensions out there to consider it.
